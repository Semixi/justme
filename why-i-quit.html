    <h1>Why I Quit Everything in 2023</h1>
    <p><em>13th May 2023, 07:14 a.m. – Villach, Austria.</em></p>

    <p>
        I was 28, held a master’s degree, worked at Infineon as a lab verification engineer
         in technical marketing for automotive lighting (shoutout to the absolute legends
          I worked with—still the best colleagues you could wish for), drove my awesome car,
           owned a Kawasaki Z750, and had a loving girlfriend. On paper? Perfect.
        Inside? I felt like a well-paid extra in someone else’s movie.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the truth is, the itch started way earlier—back during my studies, maybe even before that. I’d always dreamed of seeing the world before diving headfirst into the rat race we all know too well. You know the one: trade your time for money, get two weeks of “real” vacation (if you’re lucky), and spend half of it recovering from burnout.
    </p>

    <h2>Here’s the math that haunted me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m half Tunisian, so I’d usually spend about two weeks a year visiting family there—nothing to complain about, truly. But that left just three weeks of actual “free” time. Subtract a few long weekends, a sick day or two, and suddenly you’re down to ~10 days.
        Can you meaningfully explore a country when your flight alone takes 20 hours each way? Not really.
    </p>

    <h2>So I kept asking myself</h2>
    <p>
       What if I never really “start” the rat race? Or at least… step out before it’s too late?
    I gave notice at work, listed the car and bike on Willhaben (Austrian
      Craigslist) and sold both within fourteen days. Each handshake felt like
      paying off a silent loan I had taken from my own life.

      (And yes, I “sold” my girlfriend too… just kidding! But hey, I’m half-Arab—back in the day, we traded camels. Some instincts never fade. 😉)
    </p>

    <h2>What I actually wanted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Time abundance, not money abundance</li>
      <li>Conversations I couldn’t predict the ending of</li>
      <li>Skills that never expire (trading, building, confidence)</li>
      <li>A story I would gladly re-tell at eighty</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Semilarious Adventure: An Unexpected Journey began   </h2>
    <p>
        With €20.000 parked in my bank account and a 15 kg backpack, I booked a one-way ticket to Kochi, India—for €217. No return date. No plan beyond the first night.

        Why India? Simple: if I could thrive in the most unfamiliar, chaotic, beautiful corner of the planet—different culture, language, pace, logic—then I could adapt anywhere. Plus, not many backpacker clichés to live up to.
        
        Those first 90 days taught me more about supply chains, human nature, and my own resilience than five years of quarterly reviews ever did. I slept on overnight buses, haggled over coconuts in broken wood huts, and once had a goat in rural area side-eye my Master Thesis like I was doing it wrong.
        
        I’ve never felt richer.
    </p>


    <h2>Would I do it again?</h2>
    <p>
      Ask my parents and they’ll say “hopefully with a little more financial
      padding”. Ask me and the answer is: in a heartbeat.
